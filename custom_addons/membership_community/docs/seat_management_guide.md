Seat Packs vs Individual Seats
When to Use Seat Packs
Seat Packs (seat_quantity > 1) are ideal when:
‚úÖ You want to offer bulk discounts
‚úÖ Organizations typically add multiple seats at once
‚úÖ You want simplified pricing (e.g., "$100 for 5 seats")
‚úÖ You want to encourage larger purchases
Example Pricing Strategy:

Base membership: $500 (includes 5 seats) = $100/seat
5-Seat Pack: $100 = $20/seat (80% discount per seat)
10-Seat Pack: $180 = $18/seat (82% discount per seat)

When to Use Individual Seats
Individual Seats (seat_quantity = 1) are ideal when:
‚úÖ Organizations add seats one at a time as they grow
‚úÖ You want simple, transparent pricing
‚úÖ No bulk discount strategy needed
‚úÖ Maximum flexibility
Example Pricing Strategy:

Base membership: $500 (includes 5 seats)
Additional Seat: $25/seat (no bulk discount)

Mixed Strategy (Recommended)
Offer both seat packs AND individual seats:
xml<!-- Individual Seat: Full Price -->
<record id="product_org_single_seat" model="product.template">
    <field name="name">Additional Seat</field>
    <field name="list_price">25.00</field>
    <field name="seat_quantity">1</field>
</record>

<!-- 5-Seat Pack: Discounted -->
<record id="product_org_5seat_pack" model="product.template">
    <field name="name">5-Seat Pack</field>
    <field name="list_price">100.00</field>
    <field name="seat_quantity">5</field>
</record>

<!-- 10-Seat Pack: More Discounted -->
<record id="product_org_10seat_pack" model="product.template">
    <field name="name">10-Seat Pack</field>
    <field name="list_price">180.00</field>
    <field name="seat_quantity">10</field>
</record>
